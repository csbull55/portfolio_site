# Deployement

I'll eventually update the site with actual information and polish it up to become a little more presentable. For now I accomplished my main goal of learning a web framework
I might start to incorperate this framework as a front-end for some of the apps I'm building. Previously I was using the terminal as a way to interact and display info.
